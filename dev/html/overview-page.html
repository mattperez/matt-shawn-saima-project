              Laddering into the Computer Systems Technology Diploma program is not an option.

            <p>This program is delivered through classroom instruction, hands-on lab work and individual and team projects. 
              While applicants are not required to have formal computer programming experience, they need to have a solid 
              understanding of object-oriented programming. Applicants with no knowledge are advised to take a programming 
              language course, such as introduction to object-oriented programming, C#, or Java. Speak with us today so we 
              can help you prepare to join us.
