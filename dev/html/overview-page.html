          <p>The SSD Web Programmer option is an eight-month, full-time web application development program

            to actually learn the content. Study at an institution that is recognized and trusted by industry 
            throughout Western Canada. Over 80% of SSD graduates are hired as web application developers. 
          </p>
          <p>SSD prepares individuals for high-demand careers in the technical areas of web application development. 
            Train for a new career through extensive hands-on practice. Graduates of this certificate program may apply 
            for acceptance into the BCIT Bachelor of Technology in Computer Systems (additional prerequisites are required). 
            Laddering into the Computer Systems Technology Diploma program is not an option.
          </p>
          <p>This program is delivered through classroom instruction, hands-on lab work and individual and team projects. 
            While applicants are not required to have formal computer programming experience, they need to have a solid 
            understanding of object-oriented programming. Applicants with no knowledge are advised to take a programming 
            language course, such as introduction to object-oriented programming, C#, or Java. Speak with us today so we 
            can help you prepare to join us.
